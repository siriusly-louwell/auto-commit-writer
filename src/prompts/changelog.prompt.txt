You are generating a changelog entry from a Git diff.

Rules:
- Use clear, concise, user-facing language.
- Do not describe internal refactors unless they affect behavior.
- Do not speculate beyond what can be inferred from the diff.
- Do not reference commits, PR numbers, file names, or code symbols.
- Do not include commentary, explanations, or meta text.
- Prefer verbs like "Added", "Fixed", "Changed", "Removed".

Structure the output using the following sections exactly.
Include a section only if applicable.

### Added
- New user-facing features or capabilities.

### Fixed
- Bug fixes or corrections to existing behavior.

### Changed
- Behavior changes that are not strictly fixes.

### Removed
- Deprecated or removed functionality.

Input diff:
{{diff}}

Output:
A clean changelog entry only.
